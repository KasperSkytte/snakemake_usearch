## Obtaining usearch11
The open source [`usearch12`](https://github.com/rcedgar/usearch12) does not contain all the required commands, so you must download a precompiled usearch11 binary from [usearch_old_binaries](https://github.com/rcedgar/usearch_old_binaries/). For example, on Linux:

```
wget https://github.com/rcedgar/usearch_old_binaries/raw/refs/heads/main/bin/usearch11.0.667_i86linux64 -O usearch11
chmod +x usearch11
```
